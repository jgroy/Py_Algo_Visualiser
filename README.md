# Python Algorithm Visualizer

 A simple and interactive algorithm visualizer built using Python and Tkinter. This project helps understand how sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort work by showing animated steps of the algorithm.

## Features
- Visualize Bubble Sort (more algorithms coming soon)
- Color-coded steps
- Easy to use GUI
- Adjustable speed and data size (future)

## Tech Stack
- Python 3
- Tkinter (built-in GUI library)

##  How to Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<yourname>/Py_Algo_Visualiser.git
cd Py_Algo_Visualiser
python main.py
